An AI project for image classification with CNN and K Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
You can read our report for this project. Please see Project Report.pdf for detailed explanation.
KnnClassifier applies KNN algorithm without any feature extraction method.
KNNwithColorHistogram.py applies 2 feature extraction method.See comments in py file for information.
imageClassify.py applies CNN algorithm.See and edit parameters,layers etc. to see different results.
